# Getting Treatment

###### by Kaitlyn Keil

###### March 2017

In the so-called "War on Drugs", one of the primary tactics is teaching children to "Just Say No!" However, less attention is paid to treatment for those who are already addicted. Except for the occasional comment on how a celebrity disappeared off to rehab, there is a silence in our culture about the apparently shameful act of getting treatment. This silence made me begin to wonder: how many people who struggle with addictions actually get treated, and how long does it take before they receive this help? I began to answer this question using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health data from 2014, in [this article](https://github.com/KaitlynKeil/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/reports/report2.md).
