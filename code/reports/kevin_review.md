Using the European Social Survey, Kevin looked into whether being more politically informed
meant that a person would tend towards being more liberal. The survey was from 2010. To quantify
this, he looked at how much time the respondent spent watching TV on politics and current affairs
within any given day.

He generally used CDFs with four different groups (ranging from lots of watching to little
watching every day), also including the Cohen Effect Size.

The captions of the figures weren't helpful in the least, but he did site each figure well in the
following text. After the heart of the report (who is more liberal, here's the means, here's
the CDF), the follow up 'support' made me more confused than anything, but the conclusion did
supply an answer supported in the text above, and for the most part, the  main message was clear.
It was professional enough that nothing really stood out as bad, though the table of means was
fairly unattractive.

He never mentioned how biased a source was. I know I would expect vastly different responses from
someone who watched 6 hours of Fox News a day compared to 6 hours of CNN. With this left out, it
emphasized the "I'm a liberal who is curious about this" as opposed to "this is unbiased reporting"
to me, since it felt like it assumed the news would inherently lean liberal.

It might have been nice to have a bit more analysis on how much more polarized the edges were,
but for a first report, it was fine without that. Nice job!
