### Review of Willem Thorbecke's [NBA Shot Distribution](https://github.com/davpapp/ThinkStats2/blob/master/Reports/report3.md) 
#### by Kaitlyn Keil

I feel like this report would be more compelling if it took the data for more than one athelete and compared them, to see if the same clustering method worked for both. If it does, maybe pull in a few more of different skill levels. Does the pattern of a less-skilled player differ significantly? Can you predict the type of player by looking at how their clusters came out? I have no idea if that is possible, but it might be more interesting than throwing a bunch of different cluster numbers at it.

Your viz tool is decent, but since you say it could be used for other purposes, maybe you could give an example, or even show an example? This might be a good place to say "it could be used for other purposes, such as <______>, as can be seen in our notebook (link)."

Do you have something that marks the shots made vs the shots missed? Could you do some sort of comparison with accuracy and zone?

Showing us what the 'typical NBA positions' are would be useful for someone like me, and would help explain what 'consistent' means, or what your goal is in general. If you're just trying to find what groups it most like we do, then I need to know how we group it. Maybe part of the viz tool could be a larger graph on the top (or where ever) that shows the 'expected' outcome?

You could set this up to be some sort of prediction for other teams to plan against playing this person, perhaps. Do you have the data on the time during the game the shots are from? Does one zone correspond more to late in the game vs earlier?

Some of this is probably not in the scope of 'you have a week', but it could be interesting to look into.
