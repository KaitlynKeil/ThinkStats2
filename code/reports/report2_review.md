### Review of Matt Ruehle's Report 2
#### Kaitlyn Keil

I'd like the link to your notebook in the beginning, so i could open that up right away.

Personally, I'm not fond of stating "Question: ". That's a choice, but there are much nicer ways of weaving in the question than just throwing the fact you're about to ask it in our face. Particularly since it then goes on to be a framing, but not an actual, well, question. I also don't like that you state they are "common sense" and "intuitive" hypotheses without actually, y'know, stating your hypotheses. If you're going to have that, then break it down so that you actually state what you hypothesize what the basic relationship between production and commodity prices is.

The titles of the sections are uninspired. It's not a huge deal, but there's no real reason to have them if that's all they're going to be.

The figure captions as the main body of your text... works, I guess? I'm used to things like this having somewhat (okay, very) redundant captions and main text, so it feels strange. I think I'd like it more in article format, though. The transitions would make more sense if they weren't tied to the image they were transitioning away from.

It'd be great if you could break down what states were what in the beginning. Something like, "In the following report, California and North Dakota are considered 'high-production states', which means ____." Yeah, okay, we probably get that anyway, but I think it'd still be a good thing for setting the stage, if you would.

I found the colony count graph to take a bit of parcing. I'd like that one to be explained more to start with. Why are we looking at colony counts? What hypothesis is it examining? Why is 2002 the base year and do you have any idea why they have the trends they show?

"This conforms to our expectation that states which produce more honey will also keep more in reserve, especially during particularly-high-production years..." ...what expectation? I didn't have that. I didn't even know that was a thing we were going to talk about. You need to tell me about it earlier on, because right now I'm looking at this plot and going 'mkay then!' I'm also a bit confused on how the reserves work. Do they roll over year to year? Do they sell out during off-season?

I have no idea what the last figure is doing in here. Why do I care? You're telling me that production in one place is like the places near it, except for when it just happens to coincidentally correspond with something further away. ...yay I guess?

I don't really see where the places it goes against my expectations are pointed out. However, I also have no expectations because I have no context for what's going on. Please, please, please set more context, because I have a feeling this is all good analysis if I just know why I should care about, well... any of it.
